# Reasoning
Hey All, this is the streotypical project that all cs students do lookig to see if they can predict the stock market.  This is my first attempt in doing so I will be using the above referenced model to attempt to create a GUI for this model allowing users to use it as an on screen overlay. ![WoW!](Insert GIF Here)

# Goal
Instead of having to upload a MP4 this platform allow the user to share their screen. using what ever platform they use and have an on-screen overlay.

# Version 0
